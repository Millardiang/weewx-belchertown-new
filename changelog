1.4 June 27, 2025

Start of a new fork, since the old repo is no longer being actively maintained. I'll do my best to keep up with bug fixes and add a few new features! 

New in this version:
- Multiple bug fixes that have been pending
- Multiple code formatting cleanups
- Cardinal directions are now calculated programmatically, instead of relying on a dict
- Display colors are now programmatically calculated on a gradient, depending on set high/low values
