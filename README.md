# Belchertown WeeWX skin

### This is a fork of [Pat O'Brien](https://github.com/poblabs)'s excellent Belchertown skin. His repo hasn't been maintained for quite a while now, so this fork will attempt to keep up with bug fixes and new features. Please bear with me!

This skin (or theme, or template) is for the [WeeWX weather software](http://weewx.com) and is modeled after [BelchertownWeather.com](https://belchertownweather.com).

Features include:
* Real-time streaming updates on the front page of the webpage without neededing to reload the website. (weewx-mqtt extension required and an MQTT server with Websockets required.)
* Extensive graphing system with full customized control on observations, historical timescale, grouping and more. Graphs also update automatically without needing to reload the website.
* Light and Dark Mode with automatic switching based on sunset and sunrise.
* Forecast data updated every hour without needing to reload the website. (A free Xweather API key required. You qualify for a free key by submitting weather observations to pwsweather.)
* Information on your closest earthquake updated automatically.
* Weather records for the current year, and for all time. 
* Responsive design. Mobile and iPad landscape ready! Use your mobile phone or iPad in landscape mode as an additional live console display.
* Progressive webapp ready enabling the "Add to homescreen" option so your website feels like an app on your mobile devices.
